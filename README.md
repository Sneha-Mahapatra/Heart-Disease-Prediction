# 🫀**Heart Disease Risk Prediction using KNN**

## 🔍**Overview**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally. This project aims to build a predictive model that helps identify individuals at risk of heart disease early, using health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and more.

**Model Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors  
**Accuracy Achieved:** ~87% on test data  

## 💡**Features Used:**
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Resting Blood Pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - Resting ECG
  - Maximum Heart Rate
  - Exercise Induced Angina
  - ST Depression (Oldpeak)
  - ST Slope
  - Heart Disease (Target Variable)

## 🛠️**Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🚀**Future Enhancements**
- Explore other algorithms that might perform better than KNN.
- Build a web interface 
- Try out different features.
- Expand the grid search parameters to identify more optimal hyperparameters.
- Try and collect more data.
